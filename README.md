Hi! I’m Serena

**`Mathematics Specialist @ University of Toronto`**

I’m interested in mathematics and computer science and I'm in the process of discovering what I'm interested in by creating a bunch of random projects.
Currently learning how to use arduinos and I would like to get a raspberry pi when they're back in stock :(
