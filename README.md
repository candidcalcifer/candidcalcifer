I'm studying math and computer science at the University of Toronto and have an interest in quantitative research/development. Currently using python for most of my projects (what we use in school) but I can work in all languages and have experience in C and Java.

Some things I'm learning right now:
  - GUIs
  - time series analysis and forecasting
